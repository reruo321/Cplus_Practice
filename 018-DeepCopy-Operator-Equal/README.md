# Deep Copy for Operator=

The program shows when we should define a deep copy for operator=.

Operator= is called if "obj2 = obj1" is operated, where both objects are previously constructed & initialized.

The explanation for deep copy is written in the example, ["005-NameCard"](https://github.com/reruo321/Cplus_Practice/tree/main/005-NameCard).
