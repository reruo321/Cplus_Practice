# Bank Project v1.0

This is the final version of my Bank Project on C++.

v1.0: Instead of if-else, used try-catch on several Exceptions.

It can handle negative inputs on integer ID, Money, and Interest Rate.

It can also check if there is the lack of balance when a user withdraws the money,
or if there is duplicated ID while making a new account, or if no registered ID to bank account.

Finally, it is able to process bad string inputs for int-type variables, which can bring the system to a halt.
