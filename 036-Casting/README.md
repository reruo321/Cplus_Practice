# Casting

The program presents four casting operators in C++.

## Program Explanation

Class 'Animal' has its derived class, 'Pig'. They have polymorphic version, 'VirtualAnimal' and 'VirtualPig', which have a virtual member function.

Examples on C-Style Casting, Dynamic Casting, and Static Casting is to test three cases:

  1. Casts Base*-typed pointer that points derived object, to derived*-typed one.
  2. Casts Base*-typed pointer that points base object, to derived*-typed one.
  3. Casts Derived*-typed pointer that points derived object, to base*-typed one.

## â€» Old C-Style Casting

C-Style casting looks like this:

    Derived * dptr = (Derived *)base;
    
It is very powerful cast operator to change every type forcibly, but it may cause so serious problems that even compilers do not catch the error.

The weight output in the second case results in garbage value.
The problems are:

  1. Even if it points to base-typed object, it tries to call member function in the derived class. (Logical Error)
  2. The base object being pointed has no member, 'weight'. Therefore, calling it will cause the garbage.
